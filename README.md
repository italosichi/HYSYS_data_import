# HYSYS_exergy_analysis
The notebook featured in this repository takes data from some standard Aspen HYSYS reports and organizes it to enable analysis. Some exergy analysis and efficiency calculations are also conducted for a power plant.

The code created is very raw, but I believe it can be of help in case anyone is having difficulty in listing all streams and all unit operations from an Aspen HYSYS simulation in a friendly way. Also, the simple exergy analysis conducted for the streams can be of help.
